This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `APP Ticket Log`

Application is currently on development stage

Status of the APP:

App is able to connect to the database, record Technicians log, using a dummy data app is able to display log information by technician and the locations on the map. On click event has been program on each log to display the information of each log using a modal.

Next Steps

Create bounce event on the map, edit and delete of the logs. Build scrip for email notification.

### `Purpose`

The reason for creating this app is due to the lack for a Technician to record his work completed on a daily basis. Most Technicians carry a notebook where they will write the job completed or any other discrepancies found at the location. With the APP I intend to create a portal where the Tech will be able to record the work complete, display the location on a map, display all the records of that location by the tech and create reminder via email to the Tech if they need to revisit the location.

### `Packages Used`

The app is created using REACT with NODEJS on a Express server.It uses a MONGO database and MONGOOSE for CRUE operations.For ease of display and responsiveness decided to use MATERIAL UI framework. It uses REACT-GOOGLE-MAPS  Also has a PASSPORT authentification to create a secure Auth and Login process.
